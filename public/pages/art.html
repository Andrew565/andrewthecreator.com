      <p>I wrote this play - my first stageplay - in just under 10 hours for a 24-hour play festival. I got to read through
        the script once with the cast, and then didn't see it actually performed until I shot this video of it.</p>
      <p>I had no creative restrictions except that I had to include two props someway, somehow into the story: a doctor's stethoscope,
        and duck-shaped salt and pepper shakers. It was supposed to be 10 minutes long or less, but it came in closer to
        20.
