          hafcaf is my CSS-based single page application library. It makes it easier for developers to make websites and
          web apps that feel modern without requiring you to learn a dozen or more methods in order to do anything.

          This article is my introduction of hafcaf to the world. You can find the code over in the
          <a href="#code">code</a> section of my site here.

          There's a lot of hullaballoo some days about "you should use reduce more" or "you don't need a filter, use a
          map", or "For? Why not forEach?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, Arrays and all of their iterator functions can be confusing for beginners, so I'm going to try
          and simplify things for everyone by framing the question from the end: what do you want to get back?

          I use bash in my terminal. I know ZSH and fish and all the rest have their niceties, but I started with bash,
          and I like it fine enough, so that's what I use.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite thing to do in bash? Create aliases and helper functions for everything, especially Git commands.
          So, here's a list of some of my favs.

          There are a lot of git workflows out there. This is mine, based on working with Git for 10-something years
          now. It makes use of git rebase, so turn away now if you're scared of rebasing.
