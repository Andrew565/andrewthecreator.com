    <h2>Don't Go To Jail</h2>
    <p>Based on the classic game of the same name originally produced by Parker Brothers (all copyrights and trademarks remain
      theirs), I made this game mostly for me and my family to be able to play together.</p>
    <p>Created using React, create-react-app, Sass.</p>
