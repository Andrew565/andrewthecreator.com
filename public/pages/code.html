      <p>Hafcaf is an extremely minimal single-page application (SPA) framework, designed for people who want to rapidly create
        apps without having to learn a whole new way to create apps. If you know HTML, a little CSS, and a very little JavaScript,
        you can be creating a SPA in less than five minutes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No build tools needed - but you can integrate with them if you wish.</li>
        <li>Works as far back as IE 8.</li>
        <li>Designed to require the use of as little JavaScript as possible.</li>
        <li>Will play nice with pretty much all CSS frameworks.</li>
      </ul>
