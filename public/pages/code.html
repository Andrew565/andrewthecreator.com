      <p>hafcaf is my answer to the question "How do I make a SPA with the least JS possible, while remaining beginner friendly?" hafcaf solves one of the biggest problems that SPAs were created to solve: smooth routing and page transitions without requiring full page refreshes.</p>
      <p>hafcaf supports inline content as well as server-rendered content, meaning you can integrate this tool with or without any other JS frameworks or build tools. It was designed to be simple enough for beginners, but flexible enough for pros.</p>
