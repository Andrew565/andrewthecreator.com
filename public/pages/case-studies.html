      <p>Rezli brought me in to help them get down 'the last mile' in the front end as they were readying version 1.0 of their
        social networking app. I worked closely with their designer to determine how the UX of their product should look
        and feel for their users.</p>
      <p>The original version of their app was created for them by contractors who chose to use React.js everywhere. The core
        dev team and I were less-than-familiar with React development, so part of the work I did was to convert some of the
        JSX templates to HTML/Slim templates and taking the JavaScript components out of the React framework and recreating
        them in pure JavaScript and/or jQuery. In other places of the app, I had to add new functionality and content using
        React, giving me valuable insight as to when React and event-driven frameworks like it are useful, and when they're
        not.

    <div class="col-8">
      <p>Navigate My Campaign wanted to become the one-stop shop for local politicians looking to launch and manage their campaigns
        for election all in one place. A big aspect of the product was having a unified platform where they could create
        and manage their website along with matching flyers, letterhead, and business cards.
      </p>
      <p>I created the website generator and print materials generators using Ruby on Rails and Prawn (a PDF creator), and adapted
        and created the custom templates used by the generator. Each website also integrated with Facebook Pages and Twitter
        via API, allowing politicians to post in one place and have it automatically show up on their website too, negating
        the need for a full CMS and lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical candidates.

    <div class="col-8">
      <p>One of Firma 8's earliest products was a social network with a global audience, and we wanted a way for them to be
        able to talk to each other. Using the then-new Google Translate API, I was able to create a prototype "near realtime"
        website translator with intelligent search-and-replace capability. This grew into a full business, allowing us to
        translate content for Fortune 500 companies while preserving their branding and industry-specific terminology.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-8">
      <p>Once Firma 8 transitioned into offering translation services, we determined that document translation was going to
        be a necessary product as well. I first examined Microsoft Word's Open Office XML (OOXML) format, since I knew it
        would be easier to manipulate well-structured data. What I didn't anticipate was how much formatting was included
        in the middle of the text. This required creating algorithms which could extract the text in-full for translation
        and then remember where to re-insert the content so as to preserve as much formatting as possible. For the non-XML,
        older version of Word I used a SOAP-based conversion service to convert documents into OOXML prior to translating.</p>

      <p>I helped Firma 8 create a service whereby customers could upload videos they wished to host online and get back a highly-optimized,
        web-ready file or embed code. The process and technology we employed was so unique it was awarded a patent from the
        USPTO (Pat. No. 9,565,430). I created the front end web-based interface for the service, as well as offering consulting
        services for implementation of the backend of the service.</p>
