    <h2>Rezli - Reacting Well</h2>
    <p>Rezli brought me in to help them get down 'the last mile' in the front end as they were readying version 1.0 of their
      social networking app. I worked closely with their designer to determine how the UX of their product should look and
      feel for their users.</p>
    <p>The original version of their app was created for them by contractors who chose to use React.js everywhere. The core
      dev team and I were less-than-familiar with React development, so part of the work I did was to convert some of the
      JSX templates to HTML/Slim templates and taking the JavaScript components out of the React framework and recreating
      them in pure JavaScript and/or jQuery. In other places of the app, I had to add new functionality and content using
      React, giving me valuable insight as to when React and event-driven frameworks like it are useful, and when they're
      not.

    <h2>Navigate My Campaign - Website and Branding Generator</h2>
    <p>Navigate My Campaign wanted to become the one-stop shop for local politicians looking to launch and manage their campaigns
      for election all in one place. A big aspect of the product was having a unified platform where they could create and
      manage their website along with matching flyers, letterhead, and business cards.</p>
    <p>I created the website generator and print materials generators using Ruby on Rails and Prawn (a PDF creator), and adapted
      and created the custom templates used by the generator. Each website also integrated with Facebook Pages and Twitter
      via API, allowing politicians to post in one place and have it automatically show up on their website too, negating
      the need for a full CMS and lowering the barrier to entry for non-technical candidates.</p>

    <h2>Firma 8 - Site Translation</h2>
    <p>One of Firma 8's earliest products was a social network with a global audience, and we wanted a way for them to be able
      to talk to each other. Using the then-new Google Translate API, I was able to create a prototype "near realtime" website
      translator with intelligent search-and-replace capability. This grew into a full business, allowing us to translate
      content for Fortune 500 companies while preserving their branding and industry-specific terminology.</p>

    <h2>Firma 8 - Document Translation</h2>
    <p>Once Firma 8 transitioned into offering translation services, we determined that document translation was going to be
      a necessary product as well. I first examined Microsoft Word's Open Office XML (OOXML) format, since I knew it would
      be easier to manipulate well-structured data. What I didn't anticipate was how much formatting was included in the
      middle of the text. This required creating algorithms which could extract the text in-full for translation and then
      remember where to re-insert the content so as to preserve as much formatting as possible. For the non-XML, older version
      of Word I used a SOAP-based conversion service to convert documents into OOXML prior to translating.</p>

    <h2>Firma 8 - Video Transcoding Service</h2>
    <p>I helped Firma 8 create a service whereby customers could upload videos they wished to host online and get back a highly-optimized,
      web-ready file or embed code. The process and technology we employed was so unique it was awarded a patent from the
      USPTO (Pat. No. 9,565,430). I created the front end web-based interface for the service, as well as offering consulting
      services for implementation of the backend of the service.</p>
