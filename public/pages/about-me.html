    <h1>About Me</h1>

  <article class="three-columns">
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>My name is Andrew, and I am a writer, a coder, a husband, a father, a dreamer, and a creator. I live with my wife and
      four kids in Chattanooga, TN. I was born in California, and have also lived in Colorado and Georgia.</p>

    <h2>What do you do?</h2>
    <p>I am a motivated, personable developer with more than ten years of experience and a successful history of tackling technology
      challenges. I am a creative problem-solver that achieves quick results by thinking outside the box and using standards-based
      code. I can envision user needs inclusively, adapting to multiple comfort-levels with technology. I bring backend logic
      and understanding to front-end code and design. I am passionate about aiding users and companies to achieve their goals
      through innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>I am flexible and versatile â€“ able to maintain a sense of humor under pressure. I thrive in collaborative environments
      and am always receptive to feedback. I look for ways to improve as an individual, and also how to improve the offerings
      of whatever company I work for. I enjoy mentoring junior developers and encouraging them to reach new levels of their
      craft (see my
      <!-- <a href="#articles">articles</a> and -->
      <a href="#talks">talks</a> for examples).</p>

    <h2>Why do you do it?</h2>
    <p>I desire to connect people, companies, and technologies in a synergistic union because I believe applications can be
      used to aid people's daily lives. Technology and knowledge should be accessible to all people and available in a way
      that is simple and easy to use. I believe that I should make things easy for the user and difficult for myself. No
      shortcuts and no quick-fixes. Things should be done right the first time.</p>

    <h2>How was this site made?</h2>
    <p>This site was made using the Bootstrap CSS framework in conjunction with
      <a href="#code">Hafcaf</a>, my ultra-minimal CSS-based SPA/Routing library.</p>
