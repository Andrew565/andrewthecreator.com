        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>My name is Andrew, and I am a writer, a coder, a husband, a father, a dreamer, and a creator. I live with my wife
          and three kids in Chattanooga, TN. I was born in California, and have also lived in Colorado and Georgia.</p>
        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p>Motivated, personable developer with ten years of experience and a successful history of tackling technology challenges.
          Creative problem-solver that achieves quick results by thinking outside the box and using standards based code.
          Able to envision user needs of multiple generations and approaches to technology. Brings back-end logic and understanding
          to front-end code and design. Passionate about aiding users and companies to achieve their goals through innovative
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p>Flexible and versatile – able to maintain a sense of humor under pressure. Thrives in collaborative environments
          and always receptive to feedback. Looks for ways to improve both individually and company offerings. Enjoys mentoring
          junior developers and encouraging them to reach new levels of their craft.</p>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>I desire to connect people, companies, and technologies in a synergistic union because I believe applications can
          be used to aid people's daily lives. Technology and knowledge should be accessible to all people and available
          in a way that is simple and easy to use. I believe that I should make things easy for the user and difficult for
          myself. No shortcuts and no quick-fixes. Things should be done right the first time.</p>
