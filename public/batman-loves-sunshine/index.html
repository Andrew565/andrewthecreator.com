  <h1>Batman Loves Sunshine</h1>

  <p>When I first met Alice, I was blown away. Here was this young, vibrant redhead. We met at a bowling alley, and I was half asleep. I had been suffering the effects of insomnia for over a week when we first met. I had no idea who this woman was, nor did I have any suspicion that she would eventually become my wife.</p>

  <p>We bowled a couple games; I'm pretty sure I lost. Never had I met someone so brash and flirty, with no filters. We went to eat at Applebee's afterwards, where she told me her life story while I barely clung to consciousness. A few weeks later we went to a movie, where I tried to kiss her, and she said something to the effect of 'not happening'. We decided there wasn't any real chemistry between us, and agreed to just be friends online via chat.</p>

  <p>We kept in touch, and awkwardness blossomed into friendship, which slowly grew into a place of caring about each other. Our friendship culminated when she invited me to a party at her house, where she got so drunk she begged me to leave because she didn't want me to see her that way. I returned the next day to check on her, and we had an honest and frank discussion about the direction each of us was going in our lives. We decided that maybe we'd try the whole dating thing again, but with the idea in mind of just trying to be more 'there' for each other.</p>

  <p>We spent almost all of our time together, and within a week I knew I wanted to spend as much time as possible with this woman. I actually asked her to marry me then, though the 'official' proposal wouldn't happen for another month. We started being a couple on October 8, 2006 and six months later, on June 8, 2007, we were married.</p>

  <p>We picked the day not only because it was one of the earliest points at which either her parents or mine could imagine throwing a wedding together, but also because of the numerological significance. She was and still is a big math nerd, and in math the number '6' is referred to as a 'perfect' number. Numbers have significance in the Bible too, with the number '8' representing 'new beginnings', and the number '7' being the number of God. Therefore, our wedding day - 6-8-07 - was chosen because it represented "perfect new beginnings in God".</p>

  <p>Our new life together began in the Dominican Republic, and continued to wind its course through time in very different ways. I was a full-time database admin at a non-profit, and a part-time theater nerd. She was a full-time engineering student, but a growing disinterest in how hard and dissatisfying courses were becoming was pushing her towards the creative arts too. She changed majors to Drama for a semester, where her passion was sparked by set design and the business side of things. Alice and I even considered opening our own dinner theatre at some point (a dream I'm still holding out hope for). This led to her changing majors one more time to Accounting, where her love of puzzles and math could both be satisfied.</p>

  <p>Before she could finish her academic career, though, we found out that we were going to have our first child. Katelyn AnnaRose was born November 16, 2009, a mere 11 days before I would turn 28 years old. She remains the best early birthday present I've ever had, and likely will always be so. Her middle name comes from Ann - Alice's Mom's middle name, and Rose, Alice's Grandma's name. Her first name means "Strong lady of the lake", and comes from my deep respect for Katherine the Great of Russia, and Alice's love of the water. When I picked that particular spelling, I was positive it was the most common way to spell the name. I was wrong.</p>

  <p>A few years later, we would have our second child, Janessa Marie, born on June 23, 2013. By sheer coincidence, she was born on Alice's Mom's birthday. They're birthday twins, exactly 60 years apart. Janessa's name was picked because it means "God is Full of Grace", and I've always felt that God giving me children to care for was a sign of His lovingkindness and grace towards me. Her middle name is the same as Alice's middle name. Alice always liked it, but no one calls her "Alice Marie" (even though it does sound pretty).</p>

  <p>A little over two years ago now we had our third child and first son, Desmond George, born on May 14, 2015. His birthday can also be written as 5-14-15, which I love because it reads the same forwards and backwards. His middle name was my paternal grandfather's first name; he died when I was very young, but I still remember him and wanted to honor him. The name Desmond comes from Alice and I's favorite character from our first favorite TV show together: Lost's Desmond David Hume - the former monk and perennial bearer of calm and hope.</p>

  <p>We are currently expecting our fourth child, due sometime near the end of January 2018.</p>

  <p>Alice, it has been my pleasure and my honor to be your husband. I've loved all of our road trips and vacations. I've loved the crazy concoctions we've come up with and called food.</p>

  <p>I've loved watching you with our kids, how much you revel in them and how much they revel in you.</p>

  <p>You have always been and always will be my Sunshine. You light up my life and make it worth living.</p>

  <p>Here's to 10 years down, and many more to come. You and me babe, until the wheels fall off...</p>

  <p>...and then some.</p>
